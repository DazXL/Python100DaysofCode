#Task 3 is about Mathematical Operations
#basic operations

print("My age: " + str(30))
print(123 + 456) #sum
print(6 - 7) #subtraction
print( 5 * 5) #multiplication
print(10 / 2) #division giving a float number
print(2 ** 3) #exponential
print(20 // 4) #division giving an int number

# calculation follows the PEMDAS method
# Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction happens in this order left to right

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) #gives the result of seven

#how to turn the code above to give us a result of 3?

print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3) #by giving the parentheses priority to the 3 + 3 it changes how the code is executed
